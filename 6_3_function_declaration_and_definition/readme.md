## Function Declaration & Definition
A C++ function has two parts:

- Function declaration
- Function definition

The declaration includes the functionâ€™s name, return type, and any parameters.

The definition is the actual body of the function which executes when a function is called. The body of a function is typically enclosed in curly braces.
